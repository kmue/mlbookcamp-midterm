ML Bookcamp Midterm Project

For the ML Bookcamp midterm project, I am going to analyze a health insurance cross selling dataset.

The dataset (here downloaded from kaggle, originally provided via Analytics Vidhya) describes a sample of
existing health insurance policyholders along with their response to an offer for additional insurance for a motor vehicle.

The customer information includes details about

- demographics (gender, age, region code type, whether or not the customer holds a driving license)

- vehicles (vehicle age, previous damage)

- policy (annual premium for the marketed vehicle coverage and marketing channel used to address the customer)

- "vintage" (number of days the policyholder has been a customer with the insurance company)

- target variable: response (1: customer is interested, 0: customer is not interested)

The goal is to predict a yes/no target variable which indicates whether a policyholder agreed to also obtain vehicle
insurance coverage from the insurance company.
